# PELIProject Image Classifier

Hello and welcome to the PELIProject image classifier. The goal of this project was to take hand-classified image data from Gunnison Island on the Great Salt Lake and use a neural network to predict whether or not pelicans were present. Using keras with a tensorflow backend I was able to get an accuracy rate of 80%, an improvement of 50% over the NIR. 

You'll find my data cleaning and initial modeling in Cleaning-EDA.rmd and the actual classifier in Classification.rmd. I have future plans to revisit this project and use a convolutional neural network to improve prediction accuracy further and there is some code that I will improve on included in the Classification documentation. The images are not hosted because they are protected property of the Great Salt Lake Institute at Westminster College. 

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns at: JackWilburn97@gmail.com
